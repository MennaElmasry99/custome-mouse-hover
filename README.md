Here's a suggested README section for your project:

Interactive Mouse Follow Effect
This project features an interactive effect where a circular element (move-div) follows the user's cursor or touch movement on the screen. The circle dynamically changes its size based on its proximity to a heading, creating an engaging and responsive user experience.

Features
Custom Cursor Effect: A circular element moves with the user's cursor or touch input, replacing the standard cursor for a more interactive experience.
Dynamic Resizing: The size of the circle changes when it hovers over the heading (title), growing larger when overlapping and shrinking when outside.
Responsive to Touch Devices: The project includes touch detection and adapts the interactive effect for mobile and touch-enabled devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the page with a heading and a div element.
CSS: Used for styling the interactive elements, setting up positioning, and creating the visual effects with mix-blend-mode.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, including mouse and touch movements, and dynamically updates the position and size of the interactive circle.
